# Dialogue-System-for-Travel

This dialogue system provides a dialogue experience to the user by sending the user's speech to a Web server that generates a response to the user's utterance, and synthesizing a response speech using the generated response text. The user's speech is converted into a string using Google Home Mini and Google Assistant. This string is sent to the response generation server using Dialogue Flow, a function of Actions on Google, a platform for developing applications compatible with Google Assistant. The response generated by the server is converted to speech and output to realize a response to the user. The voice output is also performed using Google HomeMini. The response server is configured using Heroku.
